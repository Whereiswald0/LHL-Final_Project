    "## 2. Project Description\n",
    "##### The title of this project is of course a reference to James Carville's line during the 1992 presidential election, an election which would see the sitting president, George H.W. Bush, lose to Bill Clinton, a loss usually attributed to the perception that Bush was responsible for an especially poorly performing economy. In at least this instance there's likely something to Carville pronouncement, given that just a year earlier Bush had held an approval rating of 90% following the first Gulf War. Still this is the kind of sentimental 'seems-right' reasoning I wanted to apply my Data Science skills to examining deliberately.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### To do so, this project will focus on brining together data from US House of Representative elections with data from the Internal Revenue Service to address the question 'can we look at economic data and election outcomes and apply Machine Learning models to account for one or the other, and can we find a relationship in the historic data and then make better predictions about future elections based on current data.'\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Preservation -  a total avoidance of destructive processes while creating a library of formatted data to be used in the future - economic data is formatted and preserved seperately from election data, but the methods of joining them should be programatic so that any sources could be combined and fed into the model, or old data which had at first been dismissed as unimportant could be re-incorporated.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Granularity -  data should be grouped by geographic bounds of an appropirate size, so that each boundary is significant, but they don't contain too much data. These boundaries also shouldn't change often and should be unlikely to change in the future. \n",
